## Placeholders format

#### Text input type placeholders

Text input placeholders allows you to ask for simple text values.

You can define input placeholders in your snippet like this:

```
@input({"name":"hello","label":"This is some placeholder", "default":"Some default value"})
```

#### Select type placeholders

Select placeholders allows you to ask for a value from a list of values

You can define input placeholders in your snippet like this:

```
@select({"name":"hello_s","label":"example select", "options":["option1", "option2"]})
```

The "name" and "value" is the same of input type. This field have an extra "options" key which contains the list of options that will appear in the select box for this placeholder.

#### Date placeholders

You can also have placeholders to specify dates. This will be automatically parsed and dont require the user to fill in any value.

The format is the following:

```@date(':date_expression'|:date_format)```

* The :date_expression can be any format supported by [Date Parser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python library.
* The date_format can be any format supported by python [strftime](http://strftime.org/) function.

```@date('last month'|%B)``` - Render the name of the last month in the users locale.

```@date('in 2 days'|%Y-%m-%d)``` - Render the date in two days.
